# AppEnlight Javascript Client (public beta)

![Javascript Logo](/static/images/logos/js_small.png)

The AppEnlight Javascript client is officially maintained by the AppEnlight
team and uses all functionality provided by our service. The client uses buffers
to store information and send data to our service in batches to minimize impact
on client browsers.

The client gathers and gives you detailed debugging and profile
information in the AppEnlight dashboard including:

* **5 minute integration** with live application
* Supports report/log batching (no negative effects on application performance)
* **Exceptions** including **stacktraces**
* **Logging API**
* **Performance metrics** (coming soon)
* Supports report/log batching for lightweight data transport
