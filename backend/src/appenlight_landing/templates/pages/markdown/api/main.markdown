# Developer Documentation

It takes only few minutes to integrate AppEnlight with your application.

To get started you first need to [**register with us**](/register) and create a new `application` in our system.
Once you do this, you will be able to set up permissions for team member access and
additional settings (filters, priority settings, etc.).

Most importantly, you will be presented two API keys:

* `Private API key` - it is used to authorize all of your server-side clients (Python, PHP, Ruby etc.)
* `Public API key` - it is used to authorize all of your frontend clients (javascript)

After you've obtained your keys, you can proceed to configure your application with one of
the clients.

## Still can't find what you are looking for?

We will be adding more languages soon. In the meantime, you can use
our simple yet powerful **RESTful API** to 
connect any kind of language and application you want.
